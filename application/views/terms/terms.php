                including SGW and z8games branded websites (such as the website located at www.z8games.com)

                companies, joint ventures and other corporate entities under common ownership.</p>
             <p>Your use of any aspect of the Service signifies that you agree to these Terms and constitutes your
                binding acceptance of these Terms, including any modifications that SGW makes from time to time.
             </p>
             <p>These Terms do not supersede any End User License Agreement (the "EULA") that may accompany an SGW
                game
                (each a “Game”) or any other specific terms of use that may accompany a Game (the “Game-specific
                Terms”).

                These
                Terms govern your use of the Service. If any of these Terms conflict with terms contained in the
                EULA
                and/or any Game-specific Terms, the terms in the EULA and/or the Game-Specific Terms shall govern.
             </p>
             <p>If at any point for any reason you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of our
                Terms,
                or any other SGW policy, rules or codes of conduct relating to your use of the Service, your
                license to
                use the Service shall immediately terminate and you must immediately remove any Software (defined
                in

                         have reviewed and accepted the New Terms. In any event, all New Terms become effective 30
                         days after being posted. If you decline to accept the New Terms, or if you cannot comply

                         any time either permanently or temporarily, at which point your license to use the Service
                         or a
                         part thereof will be automatically terminated or suspended. In such event, SGW shall not

                      <li>Subject to your agreement and continuing compliance with these Terms, SGW grants you a
                         non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable limited license to access and use the Service
                         solely
                         for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Service for
                         any
                         other purpose.</li>
                      <li>You understand that while at times you may “earn” "buy" or "purchase" (a) virtual
                         currency for
                         use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency, "Virtual
                         Items"), you do not own the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer
                         to
                         any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, you are purchasing a
                         limited
                         license to use the Service, including software programs that occasionally manifest
                         themselves as
                         these items. Any "virtual currency" balance shown in your Account does not constitute a
                         real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of
                         the
                         extent of your license.

                         <br><br>Virtual Items are non-transferable to another person or Account (unless otherwise
                         explicitly permitted by SGW), has no cash value and is not redeemable for any sum of money
                         or
                         monetary value from SGW at any time. Virtual Items do not constitute a personal property
                         right.

                         <br><br>We reserve the right to reduce, liquidate, deactivate, suspend or terminate your
                         Virtual

                         Items
                         or have otherwise used them to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.

                         Accordingly, please note that if you purchase a license to use Virtual Items from SGW,
                         your
                         right of withdrawal is lost as the performance of our services begins promptly once your

                      You agree to indemnify, save, and hold SGW, its affiliated companies, contractors, employees,
                      agents

                      action, or
                      proceeding upon becoming aware of it. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will

                <li><strong>Seizure Warning</strong><br>
                   <p class="main-paraf-2">
                      A very small percentage of people may have seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain
                      light
                      patterns, flashing lights, or flashing images, including while playing or watching video
                      games,
                      even
                      if they have never had a seizure or blackout in the past. Children and teenagers are more
                      susceptible
                      to seizure than adults.

                      <br><br>Symptoms of seizures include: lightheadedness jerking or shaking of the extremities
                      disorientation full convulsions (which can lead to other injuries by causing an individual to
                      fall off
                      of a chair and/or strike objects nearby) confusion altered vision loss of awareness eye or
                      muscle
                      twitching If you experience any of these or similar symptoms while playing a video game, STOP
                      PLAYING
                      AND CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY.

                      <br><br>Parents should watch when their children play video games and ensure their children
                      are
                      not
                      experiencing symptoms. If you or anyone in your family has an epileptic condition or history
                      of
                      seizures, consult your physician prior to playing video games because you may have an
                      undiagnosed
                      condition.

                      replaced by
                      monetary damages alone. Accordingly, SGW shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable
                      relief
                      (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of

                         the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.
                         The
                         party requesting relief shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative

                         shall be
                         conducted in the English language; (c) the arbitration shall not involve any personal

                         by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (d) any

                         court
                         of competent jurisdiction.

                      <li>For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is more than CDN $10,000, the
                         party
                         requesting relief shall commence a claim in the appropriate court within Ontario, Canada.

                         claims
                         filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you
                         file

                         Accessing
                         the Service from territories where the Service is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose
                         to

                         suspend
                         access to the Service for good cause remains unaffected. In particular, if you are in
