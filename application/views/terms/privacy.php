                     To buy virtual currency for the purchase of services and gadgets in our game, further
                     information
                     will generally have to be provided to the chosen payment service provider in the course of
                     the
                     payment process. This information will be collected and processed solely by the relevant
                     payment
                     service provider (e.g. PayPal) in accordance with their privacy policy. We are currently
                     cooperating with the payment service providers BoaCompra, GoCash, Fortumo, PayPal,
                     Paysafecard,
                     Boku, Superrewards, Persona.ly, Openbucks, Karmakoin, MTC, OneCard, Peanut Labs,

                     Fyber, Elite4Game, Paymentwall, Tpay, Mintroute, Razer. For a successful transfer of the
                     requested
                     payment, the payment service provider may request from us certain personal data, processed by
                     us,
                     such as your IP address or user ID. Such data will be transferred to the payment service
                     provider
                     only when necessary to process or correct a billing matter, and will not be used for other
                     purposes
                     once the matter is resolved. Please read the privacy policy of the relevant payment service
                     provider before effecting the transaction. We merely receive a transaction confirmation from
                     the
                     payment service provider, which confirms the payment to us and enables us, if necessary (e.g.
                     in
                     the event of a legal dispute), to obtain further payment details in accordance with the
                     privacy
                     policy of the payment service provider, in particular your name and your contact details.

                  <p>
                     The data will generally be stored to the Smilegate Account until the account is deleted.
                     Where the
                     use is subject to declarations of consent, it will be stored until receipt of a notification
                     of
                     revocation, but not longer than the existence of your account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Please note that we may be obligated, on the basis of statutory obligations, in particular
                     provisions relating to tax law and commercial regulations, to archive the relevant personal
                     data
                     even beyond the effective date of your revocation or deletion of your account. The data will
                     be
                     deleted after the relevant statutory time period. Under specific tax laws, we are obligated
                     to
                     store relevant information for up to ten years. For example, this is related to all
                     information
                     from commercial letters, invoices, and ledgers. Occasionally, these may contain your personal
                     data.

                  <p>
                     Besides those statutory obligations, we are entitled to store your personal data for specific
                     cases. The end of the storing period depends on the purpose for which we still need your
                     personal
                     data. This means we store your personal data for at least the duration of our relationship
                     with you
                     as our customer. However, we are permitted to store personal data for longer where permitted
                     by
                     law, such as to bring, or defend ourselves against, legal claims. This retention period
                     relates to
                     the respective periods set forth by a given statute of limitation. We delete your personal
                     data six
                     months after you delete or revoke your account unless we are otherwise permitted or required
                     to
                     retain that data by law.

                        e.g. on the functions of a service used by you, game statistics, number of points and
                        achievements attained, user rankings and the time which you spend on our games, IP address
                        (both

                        Anti-cheat and fraud prevention technology:
                     </h5>
                     <p>
                        When you play online we monitor the gameplay through so called "anti-cheating software" to
                        establish whether the user is using cheating software or is interfering with the gameplay
                        intended by the game in any other unauthorised way (hereinafter: "cheating"). This
                        anti-cheating
                        software is installed together with the game on your end device.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Whenever you connect to our game online, the anti-cheating software checks the course of
                        your
                        game, the game files, and the working memory (RAM) of your hardware (when operating) to
                        identify
                        unauthorised third party programs running simultaneously with your game and modifications
                        to
                        game files which facilitate or support cheating. "Unauthorised Third Party Programs" in
                        this
                        context means, for example, "add-ons", "mods", "hacks", "trainers", or other "cheats"
                        which
                        enable you to interfere with or modify the gameplay intended by the game or any other
                        prohibited
                        interference in the gameplay of the game.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        In the event that the anti-cheating software discovers the use of an Unauthorised Third
                        Party
                        Program, the game will automatically end and we will receive the information that a
                        violation
                        has occurred on your Smilegate Account. This notification will include information on the
                        date,
                        time and classification of the violation. The anti-cheating software will be deactivated
                        when
                        you end the connection to the game server.

                        If you wish to withdraw your consent to the installation and use of the anti-cheating
                        software
                        on your device, you may no longer play the game.

                        colour
                        as the background of the website, document or email message. We use Clear GIFs to collect
                        statistical usage data about our websites, functions or other elements of a website. Clear
                        GIFs
                        also enable us to determine, for example, whether users come to our website via an
                        advertisement
                        placed by us and whether they register there or use a specific service. We also might use
                        Clear
                        GIFs in our advertising emails or in newsletters to determine whether you open these and
                        whether
                        you open the links therein. We use the data collected in this way for statistical purposes
                        in
                        order to analyse and improve our advertising campaigns and other customer communications.
                        Where
                        necessary, we also use this information to tailor the advertisements displayed within our

                        deleted. Where the use is subject to declarations of consent, it will at least continue
                        until
                        receipt of a notification of revocation but not longer than the existence of your account.

                     <p>
                        We may be obliged on the basis of statutory obligations, in particular provisions relating
                        to
                        tax law and commercial regulations, to archive the relevant personal data even beyond the
                        effective date of your revocation or the deletion of the account. The data will be deleted
                        after
                        the relevant statutory time period. Under specific tax laws, we are obligated to store
                        relevant
                        information for up to ten years. For example, this is related to all information from
                        commercial
                        letters, invoices, and ledgers. Occasionally, these may contain your personal data.

                        Besides those statutory obligations, we are entitled to store your personal data for
                        specific
                        cases. The end of the storing period depends on the purpose for which we still need your
                        personal data. This means we are storing your personal data at least for the time of a
                        contractual relationship with you as our customer. However, we are permitted to store
                        information, including your personal data, for longer if necessary to bring or defend
                        ourselves
                        against legal claims in court. This retention period relates to the respective periods set
                        forth
                        by a given statute of limitation. We delete your personal data six months after you delete

                        revoke your account unless we are otherwise permitted or required to retain that data by

                     We are allowed to use your personal information where you have specifically consented. In

                     <li>
                        It has to be given freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;

                     <li>
                        You have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough

                     <li>
                        You should only be asked to consent to one thing at a time – we therefore avoid "bundling"

                        we
                        could provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and

                     <li>

                     <li>
                        You object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate

                     reasonably
                     practicable steps to delete the relevant information.

                     You may also request details of third parties to whom we have disclosed the inaccurate or
